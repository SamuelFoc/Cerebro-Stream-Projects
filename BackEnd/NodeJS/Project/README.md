## NodeJS Routes Example

This is a simple example of how to create routes in NodeJS without any additional libraries. In this example, we will create three routes, each serving a different message.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

- Node.js

#### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-routes-example.git
```

2. Open the server.js file in your code editor.

3. Start your server by running node server.js in your terminal.

```bash
node server.js
```

4. Test your app by visiting

   - http://localhost:3000
   - http://localhost:3000/about
   - http://localhost:3000/contact

   in your browser. You should see the appropriate message displayed on each page.

That's it! This is a simple example of how to create routes in pure NodeJS without any additional libraries. You can add more routes and customize the messages to fit your needs.
